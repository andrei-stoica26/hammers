Description: hammers is a utilities suite for scRNA-seq data analysis and package 
    development. It offers functions (both getters and setters) that can operate 
    on both Seurat and SingleCellExperiment objects, intended to help 
    developers build tools compatible with both types of input. Additionally, 
    hammers provides simple tools to address tasks in scRNA-seq data analysis, 
    such as retrieving aggregate gene statistics, finding and removing rare genes, 
    performing multiple testing correction, computing the center of mass for the 
    expression of a gene of interest in low-dimensional space, and calculating 
    silhouette and cluster-normalized silhouette.
